Simple address book saved in the cloud.
This app is a work in progress for now, and has been implemented for a job application. I intend to improve it though, and make it a proper address book app.

Key features:
- Login with Facebook
- Save data in the cloud and access your contacts on all your devices (Firebase)
- Data caching in local database (Realm)
- Material design

Upcoming features:
- More fields (picture, full address, email, phones)
- Login with Google
